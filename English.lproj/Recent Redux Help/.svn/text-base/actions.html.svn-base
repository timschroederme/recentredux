<h1>Actions</h1>

Recent Redux allows you to perform a number of actions with files or folders visible in the Main Window. Available actions are accessible either in the Main Menu or in the Context Menu (secondary click on an item in the Main Window). Most actions are not available in the Dock Menu, though. <br><br>
Recent Redux supports the following actions:<br><br>
<ul><li><b>Preview</b>: You can preview the content of an item with Recent Redux' built-in support for Apple's Quick Look. You can also trigger a preview action by pressing the &lt;Space&gt; key. </li><br>
<li><b>Open</b>: You can open an item with its designated application. You can also trigger an open action by double-clicking on an item in the Main Window or by clicking on an item in the Dock Menu.</li><br>
<li><b>Open With</b>: You can select from a list of applications suitable for opening the selected item or choose any application installed on your system. Open With is not available for items which are folders or executable bundles (applications).</li><br>
<li><b>Copy</b>: You can copy the selected item to the clipboard.</li><br>
<li><b>Copy Path</b>: You can copy the path of the selected item to the clipboard. </li><br>
<li><b>Show In Finder</b>: This will open a new Finder window and show the location of the selected item.</li><br>
<li><b>Share with Email</b>: This allows you to send the selected item with Email. Recent Redux sends the selected item to an Email client installed on your system. Currently, Recent Redux supports Apple's Mail.App, Microsoft Entourage 2008, Microsoft Outlook 2011 and Postbox. If one of these clients is your default email application, Recent Redux will power it up, create a new email message and attach the selected item. You can then fill in the rest of the email message (and send it). If your default email application is not supported by Recent Redux, a panel will be shown where you can select one of the supported (and installed) email clients. Recent Redux remembers which email client you use, you can change this setting in the Preferences Window (see <a href="genprefs.html" target="" name="" >General Preferences</a>). Currently there is a size limit for sending emails of 25 MBytes.</li></ul></div></body></html>
