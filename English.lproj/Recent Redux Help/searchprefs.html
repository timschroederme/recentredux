<h1>Search Preferences</h1>
In the Search Preferences Pane of the Preferences Window you can modify the search settings Recent Redux uses when fetching Spotlight data about recently accessed items. 
<h3>Search Period</h3>You can determine how many hours in the past Recent Redux will monitor. It is recommended that the value you enter here doesn't exceed one week. 
<h3> Search Scope</h3>
You can decide whether Recent Redux will monitor only items the user has accessed (Option "only user opened files") or whether Recent Redux will also monitor items accessed or modified not by the user, but by applications or the system (Option "All opened and modified files"). Choosing the latter option will lead to significant more recent items returned by Recent Redux.
<h3>Search Location</h3>
You can decide whether Recent Redux will monitor only items located in the user folder (including all sub-folders) and the system's application folder (Option "Only user and application folders") or whether Recent Redux shall monitor items located anywhere on your local system (Option "All local folders"). Choosing the latter option will lead to significant more recent items returned by Recent Redux.
